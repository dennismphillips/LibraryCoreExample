# LibraryCoreExample
This is a simple dot net core web service application that implements various functions of a library. It's still being developed as I find time to add more functions.
Currently the web service uses a SWAGGER front end for service invokation testing, dependency injection, and dapper to manage the database connections.

If you would like to run this locally, you'll need to set up a MYSQL database named "library" and update the password in the appsettings.json file. The DDL is contained in the project which will set up all of the tables you need.
